# CST-221
Assignments/work for CST-221
My name is Caleb Miller. I am in the Marines currently stationed in 29 Palms, CA. One year ago I got a change of duty stations, being in the infantry this was a new scene for me. Since being here I have found my passion with computers. I am the SharePoint manager for the schoolhouse here and with it being a non-deployable unit, I get to take advantage of the military's tuition assistance program.

I have a wife and two boys. My wife is also attending GCU, striving for a bachelors in psychology. She is the one who introduced me to GCU and let me tell you, it has changed my life. I was nervous thinking about what I am going to do when I get out of the military but thanks to my new title and education, I know now what I want to do.
